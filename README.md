Eviction data analysis for NYC

NYC Eviction Data Revisited - 7/2/2023
Long story short, it looks like the number of evictions will double from the amount in 2022.
The long story:
I analyzed eviction data during COVID. It was at a historic low. Pre-covid, we were looking at 20,000 total evictions per year in NYC.
From 2017, the numbers steadily declined from 20,000+ to an almost standstill in 2021. However, there was a sharp spike in evictions in 2022. Crazy part is, NYC just broke through those numbers in 2023 as of June 2023, as per below:
Total evictions in 2022 (Jan 2022 - Dec 2022) : 5,074
Total evictions in 2023 (Jan 2023 - June 2023): 5,589
This means that in only 6 months, the number of evictions in 2023 overtook 12 months worth of evictions in 2022. At this rate, expect there to be 10,000 evictions total at least by December 2023.
The value counts show Brookly, Bronx, and Manhattan as the top 3 eviction sites.
Additionally, these are the top 10 zipcodes with the highest evictions:
